# Devolution's End
**Devolution's End** is modpack based around survival in a post-apocalyptic, parasite-infested future, where your goal is to hunker down and hold out as long as possible. It's heavily influenced by my playstyle of making a big base to survive out of until the end times.

Want to build a massive base, complete with farms to keep yourself fed during the end? Or would you rather fight the infection for as long as you can?
