# Devolution's End
**Devolution's End** is modpack based around survival in a post-apocalyptic, parasite-infested future, where your goal is to hunker down and hold out as long as possible. It's heavily influenced by my playstyle of making a big base to survive in until the end times.

Want to build a massive base, complete with farms to keep yourself fed during the end? Or would you rather fight the infection for as long as you can? You can do it all.

Will you survive, or will you become part of the hive?
